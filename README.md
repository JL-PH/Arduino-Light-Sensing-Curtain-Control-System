# <h1 align="center">ARDUINO UNO - Light Sensing Curtain Control System</h1>

## INTRODUCTION
<p>Introducing the Light Sensing Curtain Control System, a sophisticated and smart solution designed to manage indoor lighting and temperature effortlessly while maximizing energy efficiency. This advanced system incorporates several key components, including a Stepper Motor for precise curtain movement, a DC Motor acting as a fan to regulate airflow, a Servo Motor for fine-tuned adjustments, and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to accurately measure light intensity. By seamlessly integrating these components, the system automates curtain adjustments based on real-time light levels. This automation ensures optimal indoor lighting conditions and temperature regulation without the need for manual intervention, making it a convenient and eco-friendly addition to any space. The Light Sensing Curtain Control System not only enhances comfort and convenience but also contributes to significant energy savings by reducing the reliance on artificial lighting and air conditioning.</p>
